inlinepara3: Iaido

para3: ", pronounced ee-eye-doe and often abbreviated to Iai, is a traditional Japanese martial art that is often translated as 'the art of drawing the sword', or 'the way of mental presence and immediate reaction'. At its most basic interpretation, Iaido emphasises being aware and capable of quickly drawing the sword and responding to a sudden attack from multiple opponents; however, like most traditional Japanese art forms there are multiple layers of detail and study involved that go beyond the obvious forms being practiced."

para4: Iaido is practiced through controlled precise movements and forms which are taught as individual techniques called kata. Although Iaido is generally practised as non-contact consisting of solo kata against imaginary opponents, there are also forms that require pair-work with bokuto (wooden swords), and  there are more advanced forms that involve grappling techniques.

para5: "At Tokyo Adachi Roshukai UK, we practice the Yamanouchi-ha Iai of Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu. However, our syllabus also includes the standardised set of twelve iaido forms formulated by the All Japan Kendo Federation (Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei, ZNKR) that are taught within a number of Iaido/Kendo federations to teach and promote iaido around the world. Please see the '"
